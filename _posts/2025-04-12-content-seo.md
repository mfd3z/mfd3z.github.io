# Basic things to keep an eye when starting on Content-SEO
--- 
## Introduction

As one of the first things I did in my joruney was checking a quick basic guide about SEO. I found an interesting video of an expert in the matter called *Brian Dean*. It was a video that taught SEO for beginners and how to rank first in Google in, what I understood, content post on your web.

The things he told were  enough for a rookie like me. He talked about 6 topics that would help you get your web rank higher.

## Find 5 keywords for your content

#### Definition:
Keywords are those words that people use to search things in Google, like *sneakers*. Finding good keywords to use on your content will help Google understand what your content is about and, then, show it to the people loocking for those words.
#### Types: 
There are several types of keywords you can use in your web. The basic ones are:
- **Short - Tail keywords:** this ones are formed by 1 or 2 words, like *sneakers*. They are general and very competitive. If you are new and your web is not very popular you should not use this type of keywords.
- **Long - Tail keywords:** this keywords are formed with more words and are more specific, like *sneakers for running on grass*. Because of being more specific, they are less searched and can be a better option to rank your web faster.
#### To take in mind:
- You can try webs like *Answer The Public* to find what are the best keywords people are searching to start using in your web.
- You can try webs like *Exploding Topics* to find those new trends that are coming and start ranking on before they get full of competition.
- Another good way of searching for keywords is the auto complete function of Google. This will give some popular long - tail keywords based on a shot - tail keyword.

## Create atractive and interesting content

Better content means more views, today algorithms prefer content created for humans more than the algorithms. You want to create content the same way to want it when you search for something. This will give you more points.

So, good content. Also it needs to be a little bit long. If you search for some information you want it to be easy to find for that specific question you got but if it can also provide more useful information about the topic it's even better. Think about the reasons of why people will need to enter your web and see how to satisfy that need.

You can also try different baits to make people enter your web such as:
- Statistics.
- Studies.
- Unique strategies.
- Interviews.
- Tools.
- Visual resources.

The key is to get people to enter your web and give them the information they are looking for in a simple glance.

## Optimize on-page SEO

#### Definition:
On-page SEO refers to all those little optimizations techniques you can apply directly to your web in order to make it rank higher.

#### In this case:
In this case we are talking about keywords. We want to make Google fully understand about what our content goes about so he can show it to the people interested. 

We should put our keywords on:
- Our title.
- On the first 100 words.
- Some more times on the site.

With this we are good enough to help Google understand our site. Writing many times the keywords can make us lose points with the algorithms so try to put them the needed amount of times.

## Optimize content por UX

#### People Happiness:
Google cares about people happiness when they enter a web. If they come back to the search tab very quickly they will understand that our web is not good for people. This is why you need to give people what they are looking for fast so they find your site useful and stay longer.

#### Content layout and design:
How can you accomplish this? Being clear, using headers to organize the content or using list are good options. When you got your post written, show it to someone else and get feedback about it.

## Backlinks

#### Definition:
Backlinks are links used on webs that bring you to another webs. This is pretty common on *Wikipedia* with those blue words you find that bring you to other sites. 

#### Why should you use them?
Backlinks are used by Google to see if you page is trustworthy and authoritative. It can help your web to rank higher.

But we can find a problem due to working with long-tail keywords and new trends. Maybe there is no information to link. In this cases, and with pages that have no authority, you can be the source so other people will link back to your web and give you that authority you lack.

You can also find a topic that has few information divided and hidden in many post. You can collect all of it and merge it on your web and link it to all those webs.
